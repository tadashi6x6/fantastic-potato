Flappy Bird Game
A simple Flappy Bird game built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

Description
This project is a basic implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game. The player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes by flapping to avoid collisions. The score increases as the bird passes each pipe. The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground/ceiling. Press the spacebar to flap, and press 'R' to restart after a game over.
